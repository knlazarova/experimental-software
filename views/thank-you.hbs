  <p> Dear Participant, thank you for taking part in this experiment. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask.</p>

  <p> This research aims to examine readability of visualisations of causal relationships. We examine two different data graphs: node-link and matrix-based representations. The purpose of this study is find out which of those techniques is more reable for people of the social and health sector. Colliders and confounders are known for introducing biases to causal graphs so we examined which representation is best for indicating them. </p>
