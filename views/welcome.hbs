<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You are invited to participate in a study examining causal relationships and colliders and confounders. The experiment will start with a short training session where you will be shown two types of graphs: </span><strong>node-link graph</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><strong>matrix-based graph</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">. An explanation of how to interpret and understand these graphs will follow. Then you will be introduced to what colliders and confounders are. The training is there to help you understand how to read the information that is being displayed. Don&rsquo;t hesitate to ask the researcher if you have any questions regarding the graphs. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the experiment will start. The first four questions will be training and you can ask as many questions as you need. You will be asked to look at different graphs and answer the questions related to them. Make sure to read the questions carefully and give the most accurate answer. You will be given multiple choice questions with 3 possible answers in the first part of the experiment. Only </span><strong>one </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">of those is correct. Please do not attempt to guess the answers - there is no logical relationship between the factors. Please note that you can select an answer only once after which the next question will appear. The secoAfter you answer all graph questions you will be asked to fill in a short questionnaire. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
